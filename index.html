	<h1>Just_Joey</h1>
		<p>A webpage about me.</p>
	<h2>The basics:</h2>
		<div>
			<ul>
				<li>I'm a Colorado native.</li>
				<li>I'm a Pisces.</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
	<h2>Some interesting facts:</h2>
		<div>
		<ul>
				<li>I've been an electronic music DJ for 18 years.</li>
				<li>I've lived in Berlin and worked as a DJ and at a record label. Here's a minimal techno <a href="https://soundcloud.com/just-joey/neu-romanze-crazy-in-berlin">mix</a> I recorded. Enjoy! </li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Other random interests:</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>Reading! (Best done with a warm cup of coffee early in the morning for maximum silence)</li>
				<li>Pilates reformer - did you know that you can increase your core strength by 60% just by using correct Pilates breathing?! Just sayin'.</li>
				<li>Photography - both digital and film. Currently, I am learning 
				 nature photography, but most of my experience with photography<br> is shooting bands, some fashion photography and product photography. Here's a <a href="photography.html">link</a> to a few photos I've taken.</li>
			</ol>

			<h3>And of course, let's not forget my latest interest: web development!</h3>
				<p> I've been making a webpage dedicated to my manx cat, Suri-kat. It looks like a 1990s website for now, but I think it should improve as my skills do. Here's the <a href="suri_kat_cat.html">page</a> that I've been working on. Updates coming soon!
