	<ul>
		<li>The manx cat is an ancient breed that originated on the Isle of Man in the Irish Sea. The lack of tail that is the defining characteristic of the Manx is caused by a mutation that probably originated among the island's native shorthair cat population.</li>
		<li>Considered a mellow, even tempered cat, friendly and affectionate. Many people call this the "dog cat" because of its strong desire to be with its people.</li>
		<li>The Manx voice is usually very quiet for its size and has a distint trill which you most often hear from females talking to the kits, but with which they will reply to their people's verbalizations as well.</li>
		<li>The Manx matures slowly and may take up to 5 years to reach full growth and potential.</li>

	<p>Suri-kat is a sassy 3 year old manx who comes from the mean streets of Stockton, California. This feisty feline cat survived an accident that left her pelvis bone shattered. At the time, she was raising her first and only litter of kittens. Somehow finding the strength to drag her way back to her litter, the family were fortunate enough to be rescued by a kind passer-by who then turned them over to <a href="http://www.savinggracerescue.com">Saving Grace Rescue in San Francisco.</a>
